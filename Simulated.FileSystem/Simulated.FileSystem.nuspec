	<description>This package provides a transactional view of a file system and an in-memory simulator for that view. This makes it easy to test code that interacts with the file system.

This is not your typical files and directories API. There is a single instance that represents the entire file system. File and directory objects are bound to a file system instance and all the instances related to a single file system share consistent state.

Whole-system savepoints are built in and you can revert to the last savepoint at any time.

	<releaseNotes>Changing the names. These are probably final. At this point the API seems pretty stable. But I'm still going to wait to do 1.0 until I've played with it some more.</releaseNotes>
