	<description>This package provides a transactional view on an abstract stream-oriented storage medium.

There are two adaptors: backed by disk and backed by memory. the two share a single API and semantics: the FileSystem class. Thus the memory-backed FileSystem can be used as a simulator for the disk-backed one.

This is not your typical files and directories API. There is a single instance that represents the entire file system; file and directory objects are bound to a file system, and all the instances related to a single file system share consistent state.

	<releaseNotes>Initial release. Approximately the right API. First pass at adaptors. Neither is firm yet.</releaseNotes>
